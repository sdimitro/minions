This repo contains a collection of files that
I have gathered over time, during my involvement
with illumos.

### Repo Stucture

* `closed-bins` -
		contains the closed components of illumos that
		have not yet been replaced. They are needed in
		order to build illumos. Since they are not
		available anymore from dlc.sun.com, I figured
		it would be a good idea to upload them here
		so they can be available again. Other sources
		where someone can get these binaries are
		available of course from Joyent and other illumos
		vendors.

* `llvm-clang` -
		contains patches and other information
		about installing llvm and clang.

* `omnios-vagrant` -
		contains scripts and configuration files
		for quickly constructing an OmniOS VM for
		development.
