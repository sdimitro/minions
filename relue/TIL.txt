* Hardcoding *small* tables may aid significantly at runtime.
* Computationally you don't have to follow the mathematical
  formula as is.
* Precomputing can save you a lot!
* There is a limit on the array length which depends on a variety
  of software and hardware factors (C/C++).
* Many times the language doesn't matter.
* Caching (dynamic programming) can also save you a lot!
