- Refactor so matrix multiplication test files
	reuse some code.
- Automate compilation via Makefile
- Common Framework for testing apps (maybe header file too)
- Test MTC Apps
- Automate testing via Makefile
- Automate integration via Makefile
- Split MTC Apps
- Benchmark Matrix Multiplications locally and on Phi
	(run lscpu to see L1 cache size locally for blocking multiplication)
- Ideally kernels would not require recompilation of the library
