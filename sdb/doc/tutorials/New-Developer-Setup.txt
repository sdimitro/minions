This guide is for newcomers who want to help in the development of sdb
and don't have an illumos environment.

The easiest way to setup a developer environment is to download VirtualBox
and Vagrant, and download a stock OmniOS VM from here:
https://atlas.hashicorp.com/omnios

After you boot into that and get acquainted with the environment and the
package manager, install the essentials (git, gcc, lua, etc ...) and clone
the repo.

Typing `make help` in the root of the repo should give you enough info to
continue from there. Have fun :-)

NOTE: If your illumos distribution ships with libproc.so but not the
header of the library, just grab it from extras/include directory.
