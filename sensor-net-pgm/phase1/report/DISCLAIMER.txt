Even though this project and the code have their own licensing
which allowes them to be copied, share and modified for free
(hopefully by also giving the proper attributions), if you
ever present the report anywhere please attach the working code
with it.

It makes it easier for other to find my mistakes and easier for
me to correct them. A paper without working code, not only
doesn't add any value. It can potentially be harmful.

Thank you,
